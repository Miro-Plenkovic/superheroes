This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## if I had more time

Other things that coud be added:

- search and pagination features
- way to delete and update the entries
- way to clear the entire array
- possibly a way to import a batch of superheroes from a CSV
- the page is in desperate need of some prettifying, haven't focused on that at all

## collaboration

One person working on CRUD, one person working on the frontend would probably be the way to go and be enough for the suggested changes
